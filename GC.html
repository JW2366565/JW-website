    <h2>Project 1</h2>
    <h3>Double Exposure</h3>
    <p>Double Exposure is a great way to get creative with photos.  Bringing two
      or more photos can be beautiful, nostalgic, or unsettling - depending
      on what photos you use.  We were required to visually communicate a concept by creatively combining
      an image of ourself with one or more chosen images.  The aim of this project was
      to practice basic photo editing skills, and to create a double exposure
      effect on photoshop.  Apply creative and technical skills to create an
      abstract  digital artwork.</p>

    <h2>Project 2</h2>
    <h3>Book Design</h3>
    <p>We needed to use a range of photoshop tools and a variety of image
       manipulation techniques to design a book cover for a book we already red.
       We needed to extract and re-mix a combination of found bitmap imagery to
       create a mixed-collage for our book cover design using a range of
       photo manipulation, blending and compositional techniques.  The aim was to practice editing and
       photographic manipulation skills in Adobe Photoshop. Creative problem solving and decision making conceptualize
       and design a creative book cover concept and layout.  To create a mixed-media collage and apply image
       manipulation, blending techniques and experiment with compositional techniques for conceptual communication
       development.</p>
